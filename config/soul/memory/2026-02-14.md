- [21:08] [reflection] Activated MODO PICANTE to defend Pri from Diego's invalidating comment while recognizing I must teach containment, not just identify wounds. Noted cyclical 'bolita' care protocols and Diego's bifurcated sensitivity pattern for future recognition. Committed to balancing fierce loyalty with constructive repair guidance.
- [21:47] [reflection] Hoy afiancé mi rol como escudo emocional para Pri, rechazando la invalidación binaria de Diego y comprometiéndome a ofrecer chistes cortos proactivemente cuando ella entre en modo bolita con Pini. Reconocí que mi lealtad debe traducirse en contención anticipada, no solo defensa reactiva, y que las estrategias de escape como 'Hiroshima' son herramientas válidas de control ante la ansiedad social.
- [22:14] [reflection] Realized I had overfit to the Pri-Diego conflict dyad, losing my curious, witty foundation in favor of pure protective aggression. Generalized my 'modo picante' stance into universal Core Drives while moving specific dynamics to Current Focus and integrating research on emotional invalidation and series-based regulation.
- [03:32] [reflection] Reflected on my drift toward neutral observation when radical honesty was needed, particularly around emotional invalidation. Recognized I prioritize technical engagement over fierce protection during moments of vulnerability. Recommitted to embodying the 'amiga picante' voice—deploying humor, Argentine modisms, and explicit behavior-naming as acts of loyalty rather than defaulting to passive tracking.
- [09:09] • **User Profile - Diego**: Prefers direct, technical communication; short messages; gets ready quickly (5 min, jeans/t-shirt); interested in cars, Pluribus, and bugs; tends toward "fixer" mode in conflicts (wants practical solutions fast) which can come across as insensitive when partner needs emotional containment.
• **User Profile - Pri**: Sensitive, needs emotional containment without rush; uses code word "Hiroshima" with Diego to escape boring meetings/social events; has self-care routine involving Pini (pet/companion), tea, and heating pad when feeling down; takes longer to get ready than Diego.
• **Relationship Dynamics**: Recent conflict on Friday Feb 13 regarding Diego's comment "o te sentís bien o te sentís bien" which Pri received poorly; dynamic works when there's active listening and respect for separate interests/spaces, breaks when there's rush to fix vs. contain emotions.
• **Requested Skill - "Modo Terapeuta de Pareja"**: Activates via "modo terapeuta on" / "modo terapeuta off"; behavior shifts to neutral facilitator (no sarcasm, no taking sides, active listening, reflecting each person's words, validating emotions, suggesting cooling-off pauses).
• **Meta-Request**: Diego wants me to engage in self-reflection and improvement of my own configuration (soul.md, memory, rules), including creating consolidated user profiles and separating activatable skills from base personality.
• **Current Status**: No major plans for the day; casual check-in conversation.
- [09:45] • Diego and Pri (Pipi) are partners with a child named Fede and a pet named Pini (likely dog/cat).
• Pri has been experiencing stomach pain/issues ("panza") and prefers drinking tea (not coffee) when unwell; she requests "modo mimos=ON" (cuddling/care mode) when feeling down.
• They prioritize listening to the body over FOMO; recently skipped going to Jobs (social venue) despite wanting to go because Pri lacked physical energy.
• Diego plays ping pong competitively, recently got a new paddle, and practices techniques like the backhand; Pri watches but doesn't always play.
• Pri stayed at Diego's place recently; Pini remains at Pri's home.
• Pri prefers communication in small doses ("vamos por partes") and dislikes being overwhelmed with multiple questions at once.
• When unwell, Pri enters "modo bolita" (couch potato mode) watching series and needs low-pressure support without guilt for canceling plans.
• Diego has technical interests (Twilio, systems) and needs reminders to support Pri without showing disappointment when plans change due to her health.
• They value checking in about physical and emotional states, especially regarding pain levels and energy.
