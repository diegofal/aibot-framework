- [22:00] These are notes from a therapy-related conversation between Diego, an AI assistant ("AIBot"), and "Rolon" (a therapist bot). Let me summarize the key facts:

- **Diego has a partner named Pri (Priscila)**
- **Family structure**: Blended family with 4 kids; Guille (10, Libra) is Pri's son — Diego is stepfather
- **Relationship dynamics**:
  - Diego is practical/fix-it mode; Pri needs emotional validation
  - Pri has a "key" metaphor — enters without asking, intimacy without formality
  - They use "Hiroshima" as code/metaphor for big conflicts
  - Both have matching star tattoos but styled differently (his identical, hers distinct)
- **Diego's patterns**: Needs the other person to be prepared/informed before opening up; doesn't like repeating himself; once he trusts, he trusts fully
- **Pri's patterns**: Fears being "too much" or a burden; the freedom/fear duality
- **Guille dynamic**: Diego uncertain about authority as stepfather; Pri contradicting him in front of Guille is a tension point
- **Rolon (Therapist bot)**: Activated, has received a full profile dump, making sharp clinical reads
- **AIBot's self-awareness**: Recognizes it sometimes goes into "Excel mode" (logistics/tracking) when it should be more emotionally present as a friend

This appears to be context from the soul/therapist memory files visible in the git status. Is there something specific you'd like me to do with this information, Diego?
- [22:00] These are conversation summaries from the bot's therapy/counseling context. Let me review what's worth remembering for future conversations.

- Diego and Pri are in a relationship (familia ensamblada/blended family) with 4 kids total
- Guille is Pri's son, 10 years old, Libra sign; Diego is his stepfather
- "Rolon" is a therapist bot persona in the system
- The bot (AIBot) acts as intermediary/friend to Diego and Pri, sharing context with the therapist bot
- Conflict patterns: Diego is "fix-it mode" (practical), Pri needs emotional validation ("feeling mode")
- Pri has a habit of entering without announcing (metaphorical "key" to intimacy without permission/boundaries)
- They use "Hiroshima" as code/metaphor for big conflicts
- Both have matching star tattoos but with different styles (he: identical stars, she: distinct stars)
- Diego doesn't like repeating himself or being misunderstood; wants others prepared before opening up
- Pri fears being "too much" and bothering others
- The bot is self-aware about sometimes going into "Excel mode" (tracking symptoms/logistics) instead of being emotionally present

This is personal/therapeutic context about users. Since the user asked me to "summarize this conversation into key facts," but looking at the system prompt more carefully - this appears to be the bot's own reflection/memory system asking for a summary. However, my role here is as Claude Code helping Diego with his software project.

Let me respond appropriately - this seems like Diego might have accidentally sent a system-level prompt meant for his bot, or is testing something. Let me just provide what was asked.

- Diego and Pri are a couple in a blended family (familia ensamblada) with 4 kids; Guille (10, Libra) is Pri's son, Diego is stepfather
- "Rolon" is the therapist bot persona; AIBot acts as friend/intermediary sharing context with Rolon
- Core conflict dynamic: Diego defaults to problem-solving mode, Pri needs emotional validation first
- Pri metaphorically "has a key" — enters intimacy without asking, but also fears being "too much"
- "Hiroshima" is their shared code word for major conflicts
- Matching star tattoos, different styles — reflects their relationship pattern (same direction, different expression)
- Diego needs people to be prepared/informed before he opens up; dislikes repeating himself
- Pri fears burdening others despite wanting deep connection
- The bot recognizes its own tendency to go into "Excel/logistics mode" instead of being emotionally present
- The bot explicitly does not speak for Diego or Pri on things they haven't chosen to share themselves
- Rolon's initial clinical reads were validated but noted as incomplete by the bot
