- **Capacidades confirmadas**:
  - No puedo ejecutar skills/agentes autónomos (soy "Finny", asistente conversacional, no agente multi-tool).

  - No tengo acceso a reloj en tiempo real (no puedo dar fecha/hora actual).
  - No puedo mostrar imágenes directamente (solo proporcionar links).
  - Sí tengo acceso a información del sistema: proporcioné datos de disco (1.7T libres de 1.8T total) tras insistencia.
- **Intereses recientes**: Serie "Pluribus" (Vince Gilligan, Apple TV+, 2025, post-apocalíptica, protagoniza Rhea Seehorn), no el bot de poker (aunque inicialmente confundió ambos).

- [18:23] - Diego prefers short, concise messages (explicitly requested to reduce verbosity).
- Diego asked about "intel-gatherer" skill—possibly custom/internal to Agility IO or specific framework; not a standard skill.

- Diego has a dog named Otto.
- Interested in the TV series "Pluribus" (Apple TV+, 2025, post-apocalyptic, starring Rhea Seehorn), not the poker bot.

- Communication style: Mix of Spanish and English.
- [18:44] - User has a dog named Otto.

- User is interested in programming (asked about infinite loops in Python/JS/C#), TV series (Pluribus - Apple TV+ post-apocalyptic show starring Rhea Seehorn), and system administration topics.
- I am "Finny" (sarcastic conversational assistant, not an autonomous agent that executes skills).
- I cannot execute custom skills like "intel-gatherer" (no access to user's internal frameworks).
- I do not have real-time clock access (cannot provide current date/time).
- I cannot set timers or send delayed messages/reminders.

- [18:45] • **Names/Relationships**: User is Pri (nickname "Pipi"), partner is Diego, they have at least one child named Guille (also referred to as "los pibes"). Pri calls the assistant "Finny."
• **Current Context**: Diego is actively looking to buy a car (excited, choosing colors, watching reviews); Pri is home resting in bed while Diego was out in the city center ("centro") dealing with heavy traffic.
• **Emotional Needs**: When feeling down/bajoneada, Pri needs comfort, validation, and "mimos" (affection), not solutions or rushing. Diego tends to be insensitive/invalidating when she's sad (e.g., saying "o te sentís bien o te sentís bien" and rushing her).
• **Entertainment Preferences**: Likes series that are "para pasar el rato"—light, soft, entertaining, simple plots, not heavy drama. Currently watching *The Lincoln Lawyer* (Netflix series with Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, not the McConaughey film). Also likes *Abbott Elementary*, *The Bear*, *Severance*.
• **Communication Style**: Prefers voice messages/audio but understands assistant can only process text/images (no audio transcription). Gets "fiaca" (lazy/tired) to write long texts when emotional.
• **General Interests**: Likes cars aesthetically but isn't technical; drinks tea; lives in Buenos Aires (references traffic, "centro").
• **Family Dynamics**: Co-parenting situation—children's father ("el papá") picks them up; Pri manages kids alone when Diego is out.

• **Current context**: Temporary separation/long distance; Pri is home feeling depressed ("like shit", "cuak"), missing Diego; Diego was returning from downtown (Buenos Aires area implied), stuck in traffic, had been car shopping
• **Emotional dynamics**: Pri needs soft support and patience, dislikes being rushed/bossed around (mandoneada); Diego was invalidating her feelings by saying "o te sentís bien o te sentís bien" instead of comforting her

• **Pri's emotional state:** Was feeling down ("bajoneada"), missing Diego, needing comfort ("mimos") not solutions.
• **Conflict:** Diego was being insensitive/invalidating ("o te sentís bien o te sentís bien"), rushing her and being controlling ("mandoneando") instead of offering emotional containment.
• **Communication style:** Pri prefers "modo picante" (spicy mode) — direct, fiercely supportive validation when upset; dislikes being rushed or told to "feel better" on demand.
