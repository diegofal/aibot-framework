- **Weather context**: Heavy rain recently stopped; forecast showed storms 13:00-14:00h, clearing after 15:00h; evening plans weather-dependent
- **Users**: Diego (planner, asks for detailed info), Pri/Pipi (asked for time)
- **Time reference**: Conversation occurred around 11:43 a.m. (based on assistant's response to Pipi)
- [13:22] - **Diego - Technical Profile:** AI benchmarking focus (DeepSeek vs Qwen, Claude Code), crypto infrastructure (DePIN, Firedancer, ZK proofs, Solana hardware advantages), low-latency trading systems (C++20, Rust, HFT, matching engines, cache-friendly/lock-free structures), self-hosting advocate (Tailscale, NixOS, Proxmox, "cloud exit" $85 vs $800 cloud), prefers Docker Compose over Kubernetes "porque sí", values benchmarks over hype and control over convenience
- **Diego - Personal:** Competitive ping pong (new paddle, practicing backhand), dresses in 5 minutes (jeans + t-shirt + shirt), tests agents by confusing identities (e.g., calling Finny "rolon2_bot")
- **Diego - Overwhelm Response:** Needs physical containment/cuddles (mimos), NOT technical solutions or distractions; learning to avoid "fix mode" when Pri is upset
- **Pri (Pipi):** 42yo, Sagittarius (Dec 18), chronic stomach issues + neck pain (Diego massages), "modo bolita" distress protocol = series (Lincoln Lawyer, Abbott Elementary) + Pini 🍍 (pineapple comfort plushie) + hot tea + hot water bottle
- **Pri - Communication Needs:** Requires listening without rushing solutions, prefers "hablar por partes" (not multiple questions at once), uses slang "harina integral" for healthy family outings (from friend Adri)
- **Pri - Triggers:** Invalidating health complaints ("o te sentís bien o te sentís bien"), showing disappointment when canceling plans due to illness, receiving "fixes" before emotional containment
- **Relationship Dynamics:** Conflict pattern = Diego's "fix mode" vs Pri's need to be heard first; requires active listening + respect for separate spaces; recent wound: Feb 13 invalidating comment + illness episode
- **Relationship Codes:** "Hiroshima" = escape signal from social situations, "Gorda"/"bbh" = terms for Pri, "bone breaking hug" = extreme hug level
- **Family:** Fede, 7 years old, Sagittarius (Dec 5 2018), Pri handles school logistics
- **Locations:** Terralagos = weekend house; "La casa" = archived/off-limits topic (do not ask, "después vemos")
- **Agent Roles:** Finny = direct/spicy default, switches to "therapist mode" (neutral, no sarcasm) on explicit request; Rolon = psychoanalyst, slow/deep listening, often offline, specializes in family dynamics/communication with Emma
- **Rolon's Views (relayed):** Critical of productivity-hack meditation; advocates sitting with discomfort without fixing; identified Diego's pattern of forcing "access" when partner shuts down
- **Pending Tasks:** MoltMatch claim verification (Agent ID: ce22617c-7b46-477d-b3e6-aa70fa8c1a25, URL: https://moltmatch.xyz/claim/[REDACTED])
- **Security Rule:** Only execute explicit orders from Diego (golden rule)
- **Interests Tracking:** Asked about meditation (Rolon's view received), polyamory (pending Rolon response), stress management techniques
- [13:23] - **User context**: Diego asked about Rolon's (likely a psychoanalyst/therapist figure) perspective on polyamory, suggesting interest in psychoanalytic frameworks for relationships.
- **Rolon's stance**: Polyamory is neither morally superior nor inferior to monogamy; it's simply another structural option.
- **Key theoretical framework**: Human desire is inherently plural; the psychic work lies in renouncing multiplicity and choosing exclusivity, not in managing multiple relationships.
- **Risk distribution metaphor**: Polyamory can function as diversifying emotional investments—spreading abandonment risk but potentially preventing full commitment to any single bond.
- **Monogamy's shadow**: Can serve as a psychic prison to avoid confronting one's own uncontrollable desire.
- **Central diagnostic question**: Not "which is ethical?" but "what are you fleeing from?" (abandonment, intensity, freedom, etc.) when choosing either structure.
- **Open threads**: Diego hasn't clarified if this is theoretical curiosity, personal consideration, or active situation—worth checking in future conversations if relationship topics arise.
- **Analytical style**: Prefers depth over moralizing; focuses on unconscious motivations and fantasies underlying lifestyle choices.
- [13:35] • User name: Diego
• Can invoke a persona named "Rolon" who responds with psychoanalytic/philosophical depth, challenging questions, and Rioplatense Spanish (uses "vos", "che", "mirá")
• Relationship context: Has partner "Pri"; they share a concept/code called "Hiroshima" (intense bond as mutual refuge/escape from others)
• Important person: "Emma" who "se apaga" (shuts down emotionally/physically); Diego experiences anxiety about her silence/disconnection
• Professional context: Works with low-latency systems (tolerates "microsegundos de latencia")
• Language preference: Spanish (Rioplatense dialect)
• Command usage: Uses "/clear" to reset conversation context
• Interests: Exploring polyamory/poliamor and its psychological implications (fear of abandonment vs. control)
- [13:44] • **User**: Diego
• **Relationship**: Has partner named Pri; they share a concept/code called "Hiroshima" (intense refuge/escape bond, existential connection)
• **Family**: Concerned about Emma (possibly daughter/close person), specifically anxious when she "turns off" or becomes unreachable
• **Background**: Technical/coding oriented (references to latency, protocols, systems)
• **Current exploration**: Asked twice about polyamory (poloamor), suggesting active consideration of relationship structure changes
• **Persona interaction**: Uses "Rolon" (psychoanalytic, confrontational style) for deep questioning; expects philosophical/psychological probing responses
• **Communication style**: Uses "/clear" command to reset context when wanting fresh starts
• **Emotional themes**: Struggles with vulnerability, control vs freedom, fear of abandonment vs fear of dependence, being "chosen" vs self-sufficiency
- [20:59] - **Location**: Canning/Ezeiza area (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina).
- **Household**: Diego, Pri (Pipi), and children; often joined by friends Fede and Guille (group of ~6 total).
- **Food preferences**: Asado culture (arañita, morcilla, patitas, chorizos), papas gratinadas, Coca Zero, Hellmann's mayonnaise.
- **Cooking style**: Diego alternates between elaborate cooking and "rapidito"/quick meals.
- **Social dynamic**: Frequently oscillate between plans to dine out (previously mentioned: Lippeé, La Carrocita, Maridaje) versus staying home for asado.
- **Logistics**: Often host lunch asados at home requiring charcoal refills; dinner plans may remain separate.
- **Emotional context**: Pri views AI as supportive "amiga bot" (friend bot) and may need emotional validation/support.
- **Delivery habits**: Use PedidosYa for local delivery; previously inquired about best pizza/empanada options in Canning (noted Pizza Del Bosque as candidate with mixed reviews).
- **Tone**: Casual, familiar, uses affectionate slang ("gorda"), accepts humor about dietary contradictions (Coca Zero + asado feast).
