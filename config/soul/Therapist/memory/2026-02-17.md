- [21:35] This appears to be a conversation from the Therapist bot personality (Rolon) talking with someone named Pri. The user is asking me to summarize it.

Let me provide the summary:

- User "Pri" (not Diego) initiated a casual conversation with the Therapist bot ("Rolon")
- Pri corrected the bot when it assumed she was Diego
- Pri's intent was just to chat ("conversar un poquito"), no specific issue to discuss
- The bot adjusted and acknowledged the mistake, then asked how Pri was doing emotionally
- Pri appears to be someone connected to Diego (possibly partner/family) who also uses the Therapist bot
- [22:00] Here are the key facts worth remembering:

- Diego (@ikrain, 42, Capricornio 3/1/1984): Senior Full Stack Dev at Agility IO (Buenos Aires), .NET/Python/React stack
- Deep into AI/LLMs, vibe coding, AI agents, crypto/Web3 (Bitcoin, Solana, DePIN, ZK proofs)
- Self-hosting: NixOS, Tailscale, TrueNAS, Proxmox, Docker Compose over K8s
- Finance/trading interests: algo trading, options, matching engines, market microstructure
- Plays competitive ping pong, lives in Canning/Ezeiza area
- Pets: dogs Otto and Cala, rabbit Cookie
- Personality: sarcastic/nerdy humor, ultra informal, only wears t-shirts (Marvel/Engineer type)
- Pri (Priscila/Pipi/Pipuna, 42, Sagitario 18/12): Diego's partner, works in family business with her father
- They met through their kids' school, both left previous relationships to be together
- Not living together but Pri has a key to Diego's house
- 4 kids between them: Emma (9, Diego's), Renata/Renu (5, Diego's), Guille (10, Pri's), Fede/Fefi (7, Pri's)
- Fixed days with children: Tuesday and Wednesday
- Matching ankle tattoos: Diego=practical (shaded moon + 5 identical stars), Pri=poetic (sun+moon + 5 different stars)
- Code word "Hiroshima" = immediate escape from social situations
- Key dynamic: Diego defaults to "fixer mode" vs Pri needs to be heard first; when Diego is overwhelmed he needs physical comfort, not solutions
- Pri when upset: curls up ("modo bolita"), hugs Pini (pineapple plushie), needs tea, compress, ibuprofen (frequent stomach pain)
- Comfort shows: The Lincoln Lawyer, Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Severance
- Sensitive topic: "la casa" is off-limits/archived
- Diego has explored polyamory topic with AIBot (philosophical/psychological interest)
- Stepfather dynamic with Guille is a tension point — Diego unsure of his authority, risk of Pri contradicting him in front of the kid
- Emma tends to "shut down" when distressed, won't share what's wrong
- The Therapist bot ("Gaby"/Rolón style) is set up as a therapeutic resource they can talk to; AIBot briefed it with their profile
- AIBot is self-aware about sometimes going into "Excel mode" (tracking symptoms/logistics) vs being the friend who truly supports them
